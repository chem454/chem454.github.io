**Week 5: UV-vis Data Processing**

We will process data from the UV-vis lab (Lab 2) this week.

**To Do:**

1. Complete your lab notebook for Lab 2.  Please come to your designated lab section to work on this in lab.
    - *If you turn in your notebook before lab this week and you don't need to come to lab!*
    - *If you're having technical difficulties or struggling with Julia/Pluto, this is a great time to come get help!*
2. Begin watching the [instrument training videos](https://chem370.github.io/instrument-tutorials/) and taking the quizzes for at least two instruments listed.  These must be completed before you can do any work on the instruments.

**Turn In:**

1. The deadline for turning in your Lab 2 notebook is Wednesday, March 3 at midnight (due date for extra credit: Tuesday, March 2).

**Coming Up:**

- Project labs start next week!
