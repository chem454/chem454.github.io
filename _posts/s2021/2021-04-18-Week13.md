**Week 13: Project Lab**

You will continue with the project labs this week.  Make sure you are being very vigilant about staying on top of work!

**To Do:**

1. Come to your designated lab section.  You will work with your lab partner on the project lab. You should have completed 1-2 of the data processing notebooks by the end of the week.  You can use your time in lab to complete any last data collection/re-running of samples you need to do and to work on your data processing.

1. Your full draft is due on Sunday (Saturday for extra credit).  I understand you may not have all of your data processing completed yet, but try to complete as much of your draft as possible.  Create placeholders for sections you're unable to complete.

**Upcoming:**

- Your full technical report draft is due on Sunday, April 25 at 23:59:59 (turn in one per group).
- The peer review assignment will be due on Friday, April 30 at 23:59:59.
- Your 3 lab notebooks will be due on Sunday, May 2 at 23:59:59.
- Your final report will be due on Friday, May 7 at 23:59:59 (the last day of classes).
- The last week of class is lab cleanup.  Make sure you show up!
