**Week 5: UV-vis Data Processing**

We will process data from the UV-vis lab (Lab 2) this week.

**To Do:**

1. Complete your lab notebook for Lab 2.  Please come to your designated lab section to work on this in lab.
    - *If you turn in your notebook before lab this week and you don't need to come to lab!*
    - *If you're having technical difficulties or struggling with Julia/Pluto, this is a great time to come get help!*
2. Begin watching the [instrument training videos](https://chem370.github.io/instrument-tutorials/) and taking the quizzes for at least two instruments listed.  These must be completed before you can do any work on the instruments.  (Look for an email from me this week talking about this.)

**Turn In:**

1. The deadline for turning in your Lab 2 notebook is Wednesday, March 3 at midnight (due date for extra credit: Tuesday, March 2).

**Coming Up:**

- Project labs start next week!
