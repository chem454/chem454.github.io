**Week 4: UV-vis Data Processing + GC-TCD Data Collection**

We will process data from the UV-vis lab (Lab 2) this week and start on the GC-TCD lab.

**To Do:**

1. Complete your lab notebook for Lab 1.  Please come to your designated lab section to work on this in lab.
    - *If you turn in your notebook before lab this week and you don't need to come to lab!*
    - *If you're having technical difficulties or struggling with Julia/Pluto, this is a great time to come get help!*
2. Read over Lab 2: GC-TCD and watch the pre-lab videos.  I will help you collect data from the GCs in lab.

**Coming Up:**

1. The deadline for turning in your Lab 2 notebook is Wednesday, September 22 at midnight.
