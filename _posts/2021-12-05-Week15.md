**Week 15: Lab Clean Up**

It's the last week of classes!  We will use this week to dispose of our samples and clean up the lab and instruments.

**To Do:**

1. Come to your designated lab section.  You will clean up your samples and clean a portion of the lab or instruments.  Lab cleanup counts as a portion of your grade.
1. Incorporate edits from your reviews into your reports.  Turn in your final report by the end of the week.
1. Complete the [group evaluation form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=WluzxdUWFESO4XvecFQ_GwFnoMNxJhxDhln9pQs53sVUQTBWOFo5NFkzR0UzQ0ZSWlIyMDI1R0RKWC4u).  This is not graded, but is a chance for you to provide feedback (whether positive or negative) about your group work.  I do not share the responses with anyone.  Although the responses do not directly factor into anyone's grade, I may take them into consideration when assigning group participation grades.

**Upcoming:**

- Your final report is due Friday, May 7 at 11:59:59.
