1. ~~Complete the pre-lab assignment.~~ Since we are working remotely, I will show you how to do this in the data processing video.
1. Attend your designated lab section. (check your email/Teams for a Zoom link).
1. Complete the [data processing](https://chem370.github.io/gc-tcd/data-processing) assignment with the data from lab.  (You will receive further instructions on how to download the data from lab.)
1. Turn in your GC-TCD notebook by Tuesday, February 16 at midnight (deadline: February 17).

**Turn In:**

1. Remember to turn in your Lab 0 notebooks (notebooks 0A and 0B) on Teams by Wednesday, February 3 at midnight (Deadline: February 4).
