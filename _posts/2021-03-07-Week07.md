**Week 7: Projects & Writing Workshop**

You will continue with the project labs this week.

Next week we will have a short writing workshop to discuss expectations for technical reports.  Start reviewing the [writing guidelines]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/) as you have time.

**To Do:**

1. Come to your designated lab section.  You will work with your lab partner on the project lab.  Plan to have **at least one** of the following completed by the end of the week:

  - Completed FT-IR data acquisition and begun notebook
  - Completed standard preparation for FAAS *or* HPLC

3. Watch the [instrument tutorials]({{site.url}}/instrument-tutorials).  At minimum, watch at least one tutorial and take the quiz before you come to lab.  Plan to have all the tutorials done in the next 2 weeks or so.

**Announcements:**

- The FT-IR data processing video is posted!
- The FAAS data processing video should be posted by the end of the week.
- The HPLC template should be posted this week, and the video will follow shortly afterwards.
- The GC-MS *might* be fixed next week, and will definitely be fixed the following week.
