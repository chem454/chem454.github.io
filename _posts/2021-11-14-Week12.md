**Week 12: Project Lab**

You will continue with the project labs this week.  Make sure you are being very vigilant about staying on top of work and getting ahead of the curve!  There will be a lot of due dates starting to pile up as we near the end of the semester!

**To Do:**

1. Come to your designated lab section.  You will work with your lab partner on the project lab.  **We are getting very close to the end of the semester! You should be finishing up your instrumental analyses this week and focusing on the data processing.**

1. Work on the full draft of your lab report.  This is due next week!  I am extending the due date from Wednesday to Sunday so that you have one more week of lab time to work on it.

**Upcoming:**

- Your full technical report draft is due on Sunday, April 25 at 23:59:59 (turn in one per group).
