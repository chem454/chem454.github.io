**Week 6: Project Kick Off!**

We will begin the project labs this week.

**To Do:**

1. Turn in your lab notebook for Lab 2.
2. Come to your designated lab section.  You will work with your lab partner (TBD in class) to plan how you will tackle the project lab.
3. Watch the [instrument tutorials]({{site.url}}/instrument-tutorials).  At minimum, watch the FT-IR tutorial and take the quiz before you come to lab.

**Turn In:**

1. The deadline for turning in your Lab 2 notebook is Wednesday, March 3 at midnight (due date for extra credit: Tuesday, March 2).
2. Watch and complete the quiz for the FT-IR prior to your lab period this week.

**Coming Up:**

Next week we will have a short writing workshop to discuss expectations for technical reports.  Start reviewing the [writing guidelines]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/) as you have time.

**Other Stuff:**

The talk on attosecond laser spectroscopy by Stephen Leone, PhD should be very interesting and relevant to the class!  It's Thursday, March 4 at 6 PM.  Attend via Zoom: https://ncat.zoom.us/s/91305283616.
