We will begin the project labs this week.

**To Do:**

3. Watch the [instrument tutorials]({{site.url}}/instrument-tutorials).

**Turn In:**

1. The deadline for turning in your Lab 2 notebook is Wednesday at midnight.

Next week we will have a short writing workshop to discuss expectations for technical reports.  Start reviewing the [writing guidelines]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/) as you have time.
