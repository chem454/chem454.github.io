**Week 1: Welcome to Instrumental Analysis!**

We will meet in lab this week to go over lab safety and course information.  Extra time will be spent going over your first lab activity.

**To do:**

1. Read the information on this page, the [syllabus]({{site.url}}/course-information/syllabus), and the [schedule]({{site.url}}/course-information/schedule).

1. Make sure you can access the Canvas page for the course.  That will be where you turn in assignments and view your grades for this course.

1. Sign in to [Piazza](https://piazza.com) (check the sidebar link on Canvas).  This is how you will ask questions this semester.

      [ [Video: How to use Piazza](https://wcu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0abad82d-58e0-49c9-aa39-acb8012e0a2e) ]

1. We will meet in-person during your scheduled lab period.  Gloves and goggles are not required this week, but you should wear long pants and closed-toe shoes.

      - We will complete the steps under [Install Julia and Pluto]({{site.url}}/lab-0/#install-julia-and-pluto) ***during class***.
      
1. Complete [Lab 0](http://localhost:4000/lab-0/) (Exercises 0A and 0B) and turn them in Canvas.  There will be time in lab for you to work on this, but anything you don't finish must be completed on your own time.
