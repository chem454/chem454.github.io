<h2 id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</h2>
<p>I put a lot of trust in you to complete your lab assignments, do them well, and ask questions when you don’t understand something. Many assignments will be “graded” automatically – you will get feedback on screen as you complete them. You may not get a formal grade for these, but neglecting them will certainly have a detrimental effect on your grade later in the semester! Below are lists of the items that will be assessed for a grade.</p>
<p>(<em>Assignment lists may change as needed or if class is moved to an online modality.</em>)</p>
<h3 id="individual-lab">Individual (Lab)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lab 0 Tutorials (Exercises 0A &amp; 0B)</li>
<li>5 lab notebooks (1 for each intro labs and 3 for the project lab)</li>
<li>4 instrument quizzes</li>
<li>1 peer review assignment</li>
<li>Lab safety &amp; participation</li>
<li>Group participation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-assignments-lab">Group Assignments (Lab)</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 lab report (plus additional draft assignments)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no exams. Lab notebooks consist of data processing completed in a Markdown notebook and a data processing language (e.g. Pluto and Julia, respectively).</p>
<p><em>Please see the syllabus for a complete explanation of grading schemes.</em></p>
<h2 id="lecture-assignments">Lecture Assignments</h2>
<ul>
<li>There will be <strong>4 exams</strong> plus a final. Each exam will cover one unit of the course, and the final will be comprehensive. Formats will usually be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and calculation problems.</li>
<li>There will be additional in class problem sets, homework, and quizzes assigned and graded as needed throughout the semester.</li>
<li>There will be assigned reading associated with every class meeting. Students are <em>strong encouraged</em> to stay on top of reading the textbooks and to take notes while they read!</li>
</ul>
