<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Computers, and more recently sensors and microcontrollers, have become an integral part of the experimental chemistry and physics laboratories. This course provides an introduction to the development of custom instruments and data acquisition (DAQ) systems using basic electronic components. Topics covered may include basic analog electronics (RC circuits and op-amps), communication protocols, microcontroller usage and programming, component selection, graphic user interface (GUI) creation, and test and validation methods.</p>
<p>Although this course covers topics from the field of electronics, it is designed to help you be a better experimental scientist; it is not designed to help you become an electrical engineer. Hopefully it will help you develop a practical understanding of electronics and programming so that you will be better able to setup, troubleshoot, construct, and utilize scientific equipment. The course assumes no previous experience in electronics or programming, just a willingness to learn and experiment.</p>
<p>The preface of the course textbook provides a nice summary of our goals for this semester:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inventors in the field of electronics are individuals who possess the knowledge, intuition, creativity, and technical know-how to turn their ideas into real-life electrical gadgets. We hope this [course] will provide you with an intuitive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of electronics in a way that fuels your creativity…This [course] is designed to help [scientists] invent. It assumes little to no prior knowledge of electronics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This course is cross-listed with PHYS 454 and CHEM 554.</p>

<h2 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h2>
<p><strong>Text Book:</strong> Scherz, P. and Simon Monk. (2016) <em>Practical Electronics for Inventors</em> (Fourth Edition) McGraw Hill Education. (WCU rental book available at the bookstore)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Arduino-Getting-Started-Sketches/dp/1259641635#:~:text=Program%20Arduino%20with%20ease!&amp;text=Programming%20Arduino%3A%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Sketches%2C%20Second%20Edition%2C%20features,and%20interface%20with%20the%20Web."><em>Programming Arduino: Getting started with sketches</em> by Simon Monk</a> is another inexpensive, helpful text. Although it is not required, you may find it helpful to have a copy for your own reference (although most of the information in it can also be found online with some searching).</p>
<p><strong>Lab Manual:</strong> Class assignments will typically be posed on the <a href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D">course website</a>. (Due dates will appear on Canvas so that they link to your calendar.)</p>
<p><strong>Calculator:</strong> Students will need a scientific calculator that is not on a phone for exams (eg. TI-XX, or something as simple as a $10 Casio <em>fx</em>-300).</p>
<p><strong>Miscelaneous Suggested Materials:</strong> A notebook or binder for taking notes during lecture, a separate notebook for taking notes during lab.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Students will need a laptop computer meeting Chemistry and Physics’ minimum computer <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/learn/academic-services/it/computer-guidelines/index.aspx">requirements</a>. In addition, the computer must have a standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#/media/File:USB_2.0_and_3.0_connectors.svg">USB-A receptacle</a>, or students must supply an appropriate USB-A adapter for their computer.</p>
<p>Students will be required to use <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> + <a href="https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl">Pluto</a> and may wish to install these on their computer; both are freely available for all operating systems. Alternatively, students may use Julia + Pluto via WCU’s STEM VCAT (officially supported option for the course). A web browser and internet connection capable of streaming video will be necessary for submitting homework assignments and accessing course materials.</p>
<p>Students will also use <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">Arduino</a> and <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html">Teensyduino</a>. These have also been requested for STEM VCAT, but students may likewise find is easiest to install them on their personal computers free of charge.</p>
<p>Students will need the VMWare Horizon Clinet, available through WCU IT, to use STEM VCAT on their personal computers. The web interface to STEM VCAT will not work for this application! Students should contact the IT Helpdesk for assistance installing VMWare Horizon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard">Tinkercad</a> provides a free online way to practice Arduino coding and circuit building. It may be useful for students to create an online account.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your grade is determined from several categories of work, listed under <a href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/syllabus#contributions-to-your-grade">Contributions to Your Grade</a>, below. At the end of the semester, the total points you’ve earned in each category will be summed and divided by the total points available for that category, to calculate the fraction of points you earned in each category. Then, your final grade will be computed as the weighted average of each category score. The weights for each category are also listed below.</p>
<h3 id="contributions-to-your-grade">Contributions to Your Grade</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Homework (Individual) [25%]
<ul>
<li><em>Graduate students only:</em> This includes your “grad project”.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Classwork and Class Discussions (Individual) [25%]</li>
<li>Instrument Project (Group) [30%]</li>
<li>Exams (Individual) [10%]</li>
<li>Discretionary (Individual) [10%]</li>
</ol>
<p>Discretionary points are determined at the end of the semester based on participation, effort, attendance, and overall respect for your peers/classmates, your instructor, and their time, both inside and outside the classroom. For example, if you do not contribute your fair share to the group project you will not receive credit for the discretionary category; this is just one example – other things such as not coming to class, being exceptionally rude to or monopolizing the time of others, etc., can also cause you to lose credit.</p>

<p>These grades indicate levels in quality from excellent to unsatisfactory. Students are responsible for knowing class attendance, withdrawal, and drop-add policies and procedures.</p>
<p><em>Graduate students only:</em> Graduate students will be subject to the same grading scale, but will have additional work to complete that helps determine their grade. See <a href="http://localhost:4000/syllabus#contributions-to-your-grade">Contributions to Your Grade</a> (above) and <a href="http://localhost:4000/syllabus#graduate-project">Graduate Project</a> (below) for additional information.</p>
<h2 id="turning-things-in">Turning Things In</h2>
<p>Most assignments will be submitted electronically on Canvas. Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at 23:59:59 on the due date and late work is not accepted. A list of anticipated assignments is available in the Canvas site for the course, but is subject to change as needed.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting Assignments</h3>
<p>When turning in assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files should be uploaded to each assignment page on Canvas.</li>
<li>Files should be of the types and quantity specified in the assignment.</li>
<li>Files should be given a clear, logical filename that reflects the assignment name.</li>
<li>Files may be sorted automatically by a computer. Therefore, any files not named appropriately, not in the specified format, or submitted elsewhere (e.g. email) may not be graded.</li>
<li>Any electronic assignments turned in via hardcopy will not be graded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions that do not follow these guidelines may incur point deductions.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work is not accepted in this course. Due dates are automatically enforced by Canvas. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignments are accepted <em>early</em> and students are encouraged to submit assignments before the deadline. Extra credit of 5% per assignment is granted for assignments submitted more than 24 hours early! The due date listed in Canvas is the early turn-in date; the close date is the normal due date.</li>
<li>Each student is granted one exception to the late policy. You must fill out a <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=WluzxdUWFESO4XvecFQ_GwFnoMNxJhxDhln9pQs53sVUOEMxSk9IWThGUExPNEEzTTlONTJXR1dSNS4u">late work exception form</a> to use your exception. You may use this exception for any reason, but bear in mind future exceptions aren’t guaranteed. All work, regardless of whether an exception has been used, must be turned in no later than the last day of classes prior to finals week.</li>
<li>If you experience <em>extenuating circumstances</em> (e.g. a medical emergency, professionally diagnosed illness, or death in the family) or a <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/experience/health-and-wellness/student-concern-response-team/absence-notification-protocol.aspx"><em>university-sponsored absence</em></a> you may ask to be considered for an extension on a case-by-base basis. Communication of the issue to your instructor and identification of when you plan to turn in the assignment are important in such circumstances. For university-sponsored absences, exceptions should be arranged <em>before</em> your absence or will not be granted.</li>
<li>Some assignments (such as design reviews, in-class presentations, and exams) may not be amenable to late turn-in and therefore no latework will be accepted for these assignments. If you are in doubt about whether or not late work will be accepted you can check the assignment close date on Canvas – the close date is the last day the assignment will be accepted without a latework exception form.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="graduate-project">Graduate Project</h3>
<p>All graduate students will be expected to complete graduate-level work in addition to the undergraduate assignments. This may consist of (1) individual “grad projects” that consist large of data processing and calculations, (2) additional project work, and (3) additional problems on exams.</p>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> At the time of this writing, it is expected that all class activities will occur in person. During all in-person meetings, students <em>must</em>:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Classroom Behavior:</strong> Students are expected to attend each class period and participate fully in that day’s activity. Students should respect the rights of others and minimize avoidable distractions.</p>
<p>This course meets in a chemical laboratory. Never bring food or drink into the laboratory. This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab! Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab. Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals. Although we will not be working with chemicals, students should still wear closed-toe shoes when attending class to protect themselves from existing hazards in the room.</p>
<p>The sparing use of cell phones during class is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave your work unattended to do so!</p>
<p>In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom/laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Please email your instructor <em>ahead of time</em> if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time. Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student’s participation grade.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, cold, flu, or other contagious sickness please do NOT come to class! Likewise, do not attend if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is suspected to have COVID-19. Please maintain diligent communication with your instructor during these situations and appropriate accommodations will be made.</em></strong></p>
