<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><em>CHEM 370 - Instrumental Analysis (Lecture)</em> is an introduction to common techniques of instrumental analysis. It is designed to prepare students for careers as chemical and/or forensic <em>analysts</em> and will further introduce them to the field of <em>analytical chemistry</em> as it relates to chemical instrumentation. Students will study the theoretical, electrical, and mechanical underpinnings of the most common methods of instrumental analysis. Topics covered include spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, separation science, and data analysis. Grades of ‘C’ or better in both CHEM-232 (Quantitative Analysis) and CHEM-242 (Organic Chemistry II) are prerequisite to this course. This lecture course is meant to be taken in conjunction with <em>CHEM 370 - Instrumental Analysis (Lab)</em>.</p>
<h1 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>To achieve a satisfactory grade, students will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Summarize the theoretical bases of common analytical techniques, including spectroscopic, spectrometric, and separation methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Summarize the electro-mechanical operation of common analytical equipment, including spectrometers, data acquisition devices, and chromatographs.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine “hyphenated techniques” to reveal how instruments can be combined to achieve complex analysis goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Select appropriate instrumental methods for a given analyte, sample matrix, and detection regime.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize statistical methods to draw robust conclusions from data, especially those generated during chemical analysis.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> A scientific calculator not on a phone (for exams, a TI-XX will work but a simple $10 Casio <em>fx</em>-300 will work just as well).</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Students will need a laptop computer meeting Chemistry and Physics’ <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/learn/academic-services/it/computer-guidelines/index.aspx">minimum computer requirements</a>. Students will be required to use <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> + <a href="https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl">Pluto</a> and may wish to install these on their computer; both are freely available for for all operating systems. Alternatively, student may use Julia + Pluto via WCU’s STEM VCAT (officially supported option for the course). A web browser and internet connection capable of streaming video will be necessary for submitting homework assignments and accessing course materials.</p>
<p>The program <a href="https://lablicate.com/platform/openchrom">OpenChrom</a> allows you to process chromatographic and mass spectrometric data on your personal computer. This is not required but can speed up your data processing.</p>
<p>We will use Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and your instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com. Find our class page at <a href="https://piazza.com/wcu/spring2021/chem370/home">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade for the semester will be weighted thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lecture: 70%<br />
</li>
<li>Discretionary: 5%<br />
</li>
<li>Laboratory: 25%</li>
</ul>
<p>Your <strong>lecture grade</strong> will be calculated as the total points you earned divided by the total points available (x 100%). For exams, quizzes, and classwork, each question or assignment will specify the number of points available. For homework, all questions will be graded on the point system of: 0 (did not attempt), 1 (attempted but entirely incorrect), 2 (incorrect, but close), or 3 (perfect), unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><strong>Discretionary</strong> points are determined at the end of the semester based on participation, effort, attendance, and overall respect for your peers/classmates, your instructor, and their time, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>See the <a href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/syllabus#grading">lab syllabus</a> for information on how your laboratory grade is determined.</p>

For university-sponsored absences, exceptions should be arranged <em>before</em> your absence or will not be granted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> At the time of this writing, it is expected that all lab activities will occur in person. During all in-person meetings, students <em>must</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear a face mask at all times (must be ‘lab use only’ - see “Masking for a Friend” statement below). See <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/coronavirus/academic-affairs-faq.aspx">WCU’s mask policy</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Practice good hygiene practices and follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC guidelines</a> to minimize spread of COVID19.</li>
<li>Avoid coming to class if you experience and cold, flu, or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID19 symptoms</a>, have been diagnosed with COVID19, or have been in contact with someone who’s tested positive for COVID19 within the last 14 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these policies are subject to changes as the COVID19 pandemic continues to develop.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Behavior:</strong> Students are expected to attend each lab period and participate fully in that day’s activity. Students should respect the rights of others and minimize avoidable distractions.</p>
<p>Never bring food or drink into the laboratory. This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab! Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab. Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals. Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc. (place them in cubbies!). Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or lab coats outside the lab!</p>
<p>The sparing use of cell phones during lab sessions is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave an experiment unattended to do so! Likewise, do not place your cellphone in a fume hood or on a chemical bench!</p>
<p>In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom/laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Laboratory Attire:</strong> Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire. Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent).</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear eye protection at all times (whenever you are in the room).</li>
<li>Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.</li>
<li>Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.</li>
<li>Wear a hair tie for long hair.</li>
<li>Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After-hours Instrument Access:</strong> You may occasionally want to conduct analyses outside of class time. The instrument lab is open from 8AM to 4PM M-F; please plan your work to fit within that time (it’s OK to start a run at the end of the day and leave it to run overnight). If you are completing work outside of class you must work with a lab partner who is also familiar with the instrument you’re working on. <em>Never work in the lab alone!</em> Likewise, please refrain from bringing guests into the instrument lab unless they have specifically passed the instrument safety training. If you will require significant help on the instrument please schedule a time to meet with your instructor or the Instrumentation Specialist in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children. Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Please email your instructor <em>ahead of time</em> if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time. Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student’s participation grade.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, cold, flu, or other contagious sickness please do NOT come to class! Likewise, do not attend if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is suspected to have COVID-19. Please maintain diligent communication with your instructor during these situations and appropriate accommodations will be made.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclement Weather:</strong> Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather. Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it. Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be canceled when the University has not officially closed.</p>
