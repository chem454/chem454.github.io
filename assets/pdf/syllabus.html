<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This course is an introduction to instrumental analysis in the chemistry lab. Students will be introduced to components of the “analyst’s toolbox” through real-world scenarios, including spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography. Students will conduct sample preparation, instrument calibration, and qualitative and quantitative analysis using UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-LC), flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Throughout the semester, students will also work to develop skills related to reproducible data analysis, scientific communication, and collaboration in the laboratory. Prerequisites include CHEM-232 (Quantitative Analysis) and CHEM-242 (Organic Chemistry II).</p>

<p>These grades indicate levels in quality from excellent to unsatisfactory. Students are responsible for knowing class attendance, withdrawal, and drop-add policies and procedures.</p>
<h2 id="turning-things-in">Turning Things In</h2>
<p>Most assignments will be submitted electronically. Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at 23:59:59 on the due date and late work is not accepted. A list of anticipated assignments is available in the Canvas site for the course, but is subject to change as needed.</p>
<h3 id="submitting-assignments">Submitting Assignments</h3>
<p>When turning in assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files should be uploaded to each assignment page on Canvas.</li>
<li>Files should be of the types and quantity specified in the assignment.</li>
<li>Files should be given a clear, logical filename that reflects the assignment name.</li>
<li>Files may be sorted automatically by a computer. Therefore, any files not named appropriately, not in the specified format, or submitted elsewhere (e.g. email) may not be graded.</li>
<li>Any electronic assignments turned in via hardcopy will not be graded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submissions that do not follow these guidelines may incur point deductions.</p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work is not accepted in this course. Due dates are automatically enforced by Canvas. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignments are accepted <em>early</em> and students are encouraged to submit assignments before the deadline. Extra credit of 5% per assignment is granted for assignments submitted more than 24 hours early!</li>
<li>Each student is granted one exception to the late policy. You must fill out a <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=WluzxdUWFESO4XvecFQ_GwFnoMNxJhxDhln9pQs53sVUOEMxSk9IWThGUExPNEEzTTlONTJXR1dSNS4u">late work exception form</a> to use your exception. You may use this exception for any reason, but bear in mind future exceptions aren’t guaranteed. All work, regardless of whether an exception has been used, must be turned in no later than the last day of classes prior to finals week.</li>
<li>If you experience <em>extenuating circumstances</em> (e.g. a medical emergency, professionally diagnosed illness, or death in the family) or a <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/experience/health-and-wellness/student-concern-response-team/absence-notification-protocol.aspx"><em>university-sponsored absence</em></a> you may ask to be considered for an extension on a case-by-base basis. Communication of the issue to your instructor and identification of when you plan to turn in the assignment are important in such circumstances. For university-sponsored absences, exceptions should be arranged <em>before</em> your absence or will not be granted.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> At the time of this writing, it is expected that all lab activities will occur in person. During all in-person meetings, students <em>must</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear a face mask at all times (must be ‘lab use only’ - see “Masking for a Friend” statement below). See <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/coronavirus/academic-affairs-faq.aspx">WCU’s mask policy</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Practice good hygiene practices and follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC guidelines</a> to minimize spread of COVID19.</li>
<li>Avoid coming to class if you experience and cold, flu, or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">COVID19 symptoms</a>, have been diagnosed with COVID19, or have been in contact with someone who’s tested positive for COVID19 within the last 14 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these policies are subject to changes as the COVID19 pandemic continues to develop.</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Behavior:</strong> Students are expected to attend each lab period and participate fully in that day’s activity. Students should respect the rights of others and minimize avoidable distractions.</p>
<p>Never bring food or drink into the laboratory. This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab! Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab. Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals. Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc. (place them in cubbies!). Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or lab coats outside the lab!</p>
<p>The sparing use of cell phones during lab sessions is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave an experiment unattended to do so! Likewise, do not place your cellphone in a fume hood or on a chemical bench!</p>
<p>In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom/laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Laboratory Attire:</strong> Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire. Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent).</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear eye protection at all times (whenever you are in the room).</li>
<li>Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.</li>
<li>Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.</li>
<li>Wear a hair tie for long hair.</li>
<li>Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After-hours Instrument Access:</strong> You may occasionally want to conduct analyses outside of class time. The instrument lab is open from 8AM to 4PM M-F; please plan your work to fit within that time (it’s OK to start a run at the end of the day and leave it to run overnight). If you are completing work outside of class you must work with a lab partner who is also familiar with the instrument you’re working on. <em>Never work in the lab alone!</em> Likewise, please refrain from bringing guests into the instrument lab unless they have specifically passed the instrument safety training. If you will require significant help on the instrument please schedule a time to meet with your instructor or the Instrumentation Specialist in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children. Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Please email your instructor <em>ahead of time</em> if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time. Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student’s participation grade.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19, cold, flu, or other contagious sickness please do NOT come to class! Likewise, do not attend if you have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 or is suspected to have COVID-19. Please maintain diligent communication with your instructor during these situations and appropriate accommodations will be made.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclement Weather:</strong> Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather. Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it. Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be canceled when the University has not officially closed.</p>
