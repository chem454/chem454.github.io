## Memorandum

***Western Analytics, Inc.***

**To:** Aerosol Exposure Division  
**From:** Al Fischer, PhD    
**Subject:** e-Cigarette Liquid Analysis   

**Western Analysts:**

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung injury (EVALI) began in June 2019.  It continues today, and will continue until a culprit is found.  As of December 17, 2019 a total of **2,506 EVALI hospitalizations** from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands), and **54 EVALI deaths** from 27 US states have been reported to CDC. Studies have found vitamin E acetate, plant and vegetable oils, petroleum distillates, and terpenes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of many affected individuals. [1]  The figure below shows some common chemical exposures from e-cigarettes.

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is seeking our help in finding the cause of the outbreak in NC. (See [this WLOS story](https://wlos.com/news/local/nc-health-officials-report-3-cases-of-severe-lung-disease-after-vaping) for additional information.) We are asked to screen e-cigarette liquid for toxicants.

**Your job is to screen the products for:**  

  1. Flavoring compounds using GC-MS  
  2. Nicotine concentration using HPLC  
  3. Zinc concentration using flame AA (before and after vaping)  
  4. General adulteration using FTIR and the Hit Quality Index method in [Rodriguez et al 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Clarkson6/post/What_are_some_good_reference_bands_for_Raman_spectroscopy/attachment/59d6244c79197b8077982a27/AS%3A312109580128257%401451424130311/download/Standardization+of+Raman+spectra+for+transfer+of+spectral+libraries+across+different+instruments.pdf).   

Please turn in a technical report detailing the findings of your analyses.  Your report should link together the results from all your analyses, use complementary results to bolster your conclusions, and discuss what implications the findings from each analysis have on human health.

**Sample Information:**

NCDHHS asked EVALI patients which types of of vaping liquids they used.  NCDHHS acquired these products and sent them to Western Analytics for characterization.  Aliquots of two samples will be randomly assigned to your workgroup for analysis.  Some samples are regulated off-the-shelf e-cigarette liquid and some may be home-made or "black-market" samples.  You may find problems with one, both, or none of your samples.  You will also be given a toxicant-free reference sample.  Although samples are over-the-counter products, they are all presumed toxic; you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin.

##### **Record Keeping:** 

Due to the high-impact nature of this work, you must diligently keep track of all sample information (e.g. samples names) and data.  You must also follow our standard quality-control and data-validation practices to ensure your results are accurate.  Likewise, all results must meet the precision guidelines described in the procedure for each instrument.

##### *Keep in mind:*  

- There are no additional samples available -- plan ahead to make sure you don't use up all your sample!  
- The lot number for each sample (provided on the bag/vial) must be explicitly tracked in your lab notebook and final report.  
- You must provide me with your data files and lab notebooks (in addition to your report) for validation.  
- You must get certified on each instrument prior to using it.  

This is of utmost importance.  The sooner the culprit(s) is (are) found, the sooner we can help get dangerous products off the shelf, and the more lives we can save!
