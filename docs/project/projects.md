# Project Information
{: .no_toc  }

----

*This course will be heavily based around project work.  This section of the site is a repository of information regarding the project.  It will continue to update throughout the semester.*


Over the course of the semester each of you will construct a working scientific instrument.  You will be guided through this project over the course of the semester, and the first part of the semester will be spent doing background research and developing a plan for your instrument.  The second half the semester will be spent building and testing the instrument, and presenting your work.  This semester the project will consist of **building a UV-visible spectrometer**.

The spectrometer you build should:
- Cover the spectral range of 400-700 nm, minimum (i.e. it is a visible spectrometer)
- Be able to collect an entire spectrum at once (i.e. it does not scan wavelengths)
- Be small and portable
- Be *rugged* -- that is, you can carry it around and not have to worry about realigning/calibrating it when you get to a new location.
- Be *robust*, including immunity to stray light.
- Be easily constructed with off-the-shelf components or 3D-printed parts.
- Cost \<$200.
- If you are a graduate student, your instrument should also have the ability to measure fluoresence.

(If you are struggling to remember these definitions, review [*Analytical Chemistry 2.1*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_%28Harvey%29) by David Harvey, specifically Chapter 3.)

# Assignments

1. Your first goal is to research prior art, or work by other scientists that may be similar.  One starting point is the paper "Development of a Low-Cost UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and Its Application for the Detection of Mercuric Ions Assisted by Chemosensors" (González-Morales et al 2019). [DOI:[10.3390/s20030906](http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20030906)]
	1. Read the paper.  We will discuss it in class.
	1. Complete the discussion sheet *prior* to coming to the class discussion on the paper.
	2. Find a second high-quality, *peer-reviewed* paper you think is relevant to this project.  I will post the papers on Canvas as they are submitted, and you should not submit the same paper as another student.  The goal here is for us as a class to gather as much different information as possible about this topic.  There are plenty of ways of finding papers, including Google Scholar, library databases, etc.  Please ask for help if you are unsure how to find a paper or have questions about whether the paper you found is appropriate.
	1. There will be additional steps after papers are submitted.

2. Your next goal is to begin designing an instrument and selecting components.
	1. You should meet with your group outside of class to come up with a design for your instrument.  **You will meet with me for a design review during week 3 or 4, depending on which group you are in.**
	1. You should come to the first design review with slides that have a basic description of your instrument.  At minimum, you should have:
		1. A basic block diagram of what you plan to build (see Figure 3 in González-Morales et al 2019) for an example of the detail expected.
		1. A tentative plan for how you will test and validate your spectrometer. You will likely want to find some sort of standard sample to measure and compare it to a commercial instrument.
