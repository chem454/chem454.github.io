<!-- ## How to Write a Technical Report -->

<!-- Students often struggle to see the difference between lab notebooks and technical reports.  The lab notebook is an *exact* record of what you did in lab and should include everything you do; the technical report is the polished story summarizing your study and should be curated accordingly (curated for clarity, not to sweep findings under the rug!). -->

<!-- Follow the guidelines below when writing your report.  Your report should be formatted according to the [ACS Style Guide](https://pubs.acs.org/isbn/9780841239999#) (template below). -->

<!-- - Dr. Fischer's [Writing Tips]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/writing-guide) (based on common mistakes) -->
<!-- - Dr. Fischer's [Publication-quality Figures Guide]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/figures) -->
<!-- - You report should contain the following sections (click each link for info on that section): -->
<!--     - [Title and Abstract]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/title-abstract) -->
<!--     - [Introduction]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/introduction) -->
<!--     - [Materials and Methods]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/materials-methods) -->
<!--     - [Results and Discussion]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/results-discussion) -->
<!--     - [Conclusions]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/conclusion) -->
<!--     - [References]({{site.url}}/technical-reports/references) -->

<!-- ## How you'll be graded -->

<!-- - Each group will turn in one comprehensive technical report at the end of the semester, written as a team.   -->
<!-- - The writing of this report will be completed in stages.   -->
<!--   - You will submit sections throughout the semester and will be given *qualitative* feedback on that section.   -->
<!--   - You will then be expected to integrate this feedback into your report before submitting it at the end of the semester.   -->
<!--   - Peer review will also be used as a tool for providing feedback.   -->
  
<!--   *The more polished your draft is the more I am able to give you meaningful feedback and the higher your final grade will be!* -->

<!-- - Your final submission will be graded *quantitatively* according to the lab ***[report rubric](https://github.com/alphonse/alphonse.github.io/raw/master/chem370/pdf/lab-report-rubric.pdf)*** (PDF). -->
