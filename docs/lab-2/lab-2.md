## Summary

**Objective:**
Determine the concentration of quinine in tonic water using fluorescence spectroscopy.

**Turn in:**
  - Your complete lab notebook as a .jl file, functioning with no errors.
  - You complete lab notebook as a static .html file.
  - Your data files.

**Student Learning Outcomes:**
  - Recall methods of creating standards and standard curves from Quantitative Analysis.
  - Determine the concentration of quinine in an unknown sample, including the 95% confidence interval.
  - Calculate the limits of detection limits of quantitation from a blank sample.
  - Employ a quality control sample to check the accuracy of their results.
  - Utilize Pluto (with Markdown) as an electronic lab notebook.
  - Utilize Julia functions to analyze spectroscopic data.

## Introduction

This lab will use Vernier SpectroVis Plus UV-visible/fluorescence spectrometers to quantify the amount of quinine in tonic water. You will be given a sample of store-bought tonic water and a concentrated stock solution of quinine. You will then dilute the stock solution to create a standard curve and determine the concentration of quinine in (1) a commercial tonic water sample of unknown concentration and (2) a quality-control sample of known concentration to test the accuracy of your curve. Samples will be measured in triplicate so that you can determine the mean concentration and the 95% confidence interval.  The limit of quantitation (LOQ) will be determined from a blank sample.

Students should work in pairs for the lab activity but turn in independent lab notebooks.

Watch Dr. Fischer teardown a SpectroVis and find out what’s inside!

## Prelab

Do the following *before* coming to lab:

- Prepare your lab notebook, including calculations of your standard concentrations (more info in the Prelab section).
- Install [Vernier Spectral Analysis](https://www.vernier.com/product/spectral-analysis/) on your computer.

## Safety

- This lab uses 0.05 M sulfuric acid (SDS). Wear goggles and gloves.
- Tonic water contains quinine hydrochloride and the stock solution contains quinine sulfate.
- Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin.
