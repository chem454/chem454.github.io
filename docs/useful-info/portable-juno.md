# How to Make a Portable Installation of Juno

The Julia IDE Juno is built on Atom.  This can be problematic when trying to use both Atom and Juno.  One solution is to create a portable installation of Atom that is used as the Juno installation, and maintain a normal installation of Atom for routine Atom work.  The steps below describe how to create the portable installation of Atom.

1. Download the [Atom ZIP file](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest) and extract to the desired location.
1. Create a folder next to the extracted Atom app called `.atom`.
1. If desired, change the name to Juno and the icon to the Juno icon.
1. Install Juno through the Atom package manager.
