# Project Information
{: .no_toc  }

----

At present, the plan is to use Julia to write a graphic user interface (GUI) for your isntruments.  Information about how to do that will be given here.

Graduate students may also find it useful to use Julia and Pluto for the graduate project.  Check back here later in the semester for tutorials.
