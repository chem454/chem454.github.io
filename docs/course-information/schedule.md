# Tentative Course Schedule

Much of this course will be project-based.  In general, I intend to use Tuesdays to cover theory and background material and Thursdays for hands-on project work (but there will some exceptions to this).  The schedule is *very* tentative and subject to change!

Activities in **bold** require you to bring a computer and USB converter.

## Potential Topics for TBD Days

- Rotation lab (after Function Gen)
- PWM
- Motors
- PID Loops
- Lights
- Using DMMs, Scopes, etc.
- Soldering
- Voltage divider
- Exams
- Impedance
- Digital-to-analog converters (homemade dac, comparison to IC DAC)
- Comparing different temperature sensors

*Design reviews will be held on Thursdays during class time.*


# Anticipated Assignments

Most assignments in this course will be centered around the construction of a working instrument.  Prior to Spring Break students will work to develop a design for their instrument.  All students should begin constructing their instruments no later than the week returning from Spring Break.

- Weekly(-ish) homework assignments (Individual)
- Weekly(-ish) Arduino / Teensy assignments (Individual)
- Instrument build project (Group)
	- Bi-weekly design review check-ins
	- Presentation on proposed design (midterm)
	- Instrument design packet (midterm)
	- Instrument hardware working
	- Instrument software working
	- Data collection / validation activity
	- Instrument technical datasheet
- Final exam (individual)


# Grad Projects

Graduate students will complete additional activities over the course of the semester:

1. A graduate project involving computational circuit analysis, with modules due throughout the semester.
1. Modify their instrument to incorporate additional functionality.
1. Answer additional questions on exams.
