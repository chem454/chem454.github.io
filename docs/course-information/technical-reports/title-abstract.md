# Title & Abstract

Your title should be *succinct yet descriptive*.  Keep it general enough that it doesn't scare people off (avoid using jargon and unusual abbreviations), but make it specific enough that potential readers find it intriguing.  A good title is usually 10-15 words, occasionally a little more occasionally a little less.

The abstract should be a complete summary of your paper.  One or two sentences per section of your paper is usually a good starting point.  In other words, have one or two sentences summarizing the intro, a sentence describing the methods you used, and another sentence or two summarizing your results.
