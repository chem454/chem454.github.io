# Conslusion

The conclusion should provide a brief summary of the results, highlighting the key breakthroughs or findings.  It should specifically relate the conclusions back to the research questions posed in the introduction and explain their significance.  Finally, it should provide recommendations for future improvements or expansions upon the study.  It should not just repeat other portions of the paper.

> The Conclusions section should allow for opportunistic reading. When writing this section, imagine a reader who reads the introduction, skims through the figures, then jumps to the conclusion. The conclusion should concisely provide the key message(s) the author wishes to convey. [1]
