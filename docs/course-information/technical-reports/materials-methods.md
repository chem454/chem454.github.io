# Materials and Methods

The methods section provides the reader of your manuscript a *detailed* account of how you completed your study.  It should contain enough information that the reader could complete your study with no other resources.  However, it should *not* contain extraneous details or irrelevant minutia.  More information about what constitutes appropriate detail is provided in Mack (2018). [1]

> There are really two interrelated goals at work: the reader should be given the ability to reproduce the results and the ability to judge the results. [1]

For this assignment, you should turn in a methods section to your final paper that details your sensor construction and deployment.

**Style tips:**

- Write in *past tense*.  
- Use active voice (first-person is OK, too).  
- All tables must have a title *above* the table and be numbered sequentially.  
- All figures (images or graphs) must have a caption (that includes a title and brief description of the figure) *below* the figure and be numbered sequentially.  

**Example table formatting:**

  *Table 1: A table with a lot of useful information*

  | Column 1      | Column 2       |
  | ------------- | -------------- |
  | a bit of info | some more info |
  | a bit of info | some more info |  
  | a bit of info | some more info |


**Example figure formatting:**
