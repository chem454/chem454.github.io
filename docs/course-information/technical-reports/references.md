# References & Scholarly Sources

You should only cite *scholarly* sources.  Points may be deducted for sources that do not meet the qualifications of a scholarly source.  The lab manual is not a scholarly source!  Please refer to this [flowchart](https://www.library.illinois.edu/ugl/howdoi/scholarly/) to determine if your source counts as scholarly.  If in doubt, it's probably *not* scholarly.  

Your references should be cited in a separate "References" section at the end of your report in the [ACS (JACS) format](https://libguides.williams.edu/citing/acs).  Citations should be numbered by the order in which they appear in the text and referred to by number.  All citations that appear in the text MUST be cited, and all citations listed in the references section must appear in the text.  Journal titles should be in italic font and may be abbreviated according using the standard journal abbreviation found in the [CASSI database](https://cassi.cas.org/).  Year of publishing should be in bold font.  Include a DOI number in your references.

**Example of citing a Journal Article:**

Photoacoustic spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for measuring light absorption by atmospheric aerosols. (1)
