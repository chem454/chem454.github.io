# Writing a Technical Report
{: .no_toc  }

Each group will write one technical report that summarizes their findings for the semester and answers the questions set forth in the memorandum provided with the lab assignment.  Your reports are expected to be professional quality.  You should write them as if you were going to submit it to a professional chemistry journal (e.g. *Analytical Chemistry*). Although there is no specific length requirements, I find that the best reports tend to fall somewhere around 20 pages (1.5 line spacing, including figures, tables and references).

## How to Write a Technical Report

Students often struggle to see the difference between lab notebooks and technical reports.  The lab notebook is an *exact* record of what you did in lab and should include everything you do; the technical report is the polished story summarizing your study and should be curated accordingly (curated for clarity, not to sweep findings under the rug!).

Follow the guidelines below when writing your report.  Your report should be formatted according to the [ACS Style Guide](https://pubs.acs.org/isbn/9780841239999#) (template below).

- Dr. Fischer's [Writing Tips]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/writing-guide) (based on common mistakes)
- Dr. Fischer's [Publication-quality Figures Guide]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/figures)
- You report should contain the following sections (click each link for info on that section):
    - [Title and Abstract]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/title-abstract)
    - [Introduction]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/introduction)
    - [Materials and Methods]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/materials-methods)
    - [Results and Discussion]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/results-discussion)
    - [Conclusions]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/conclusion)
    - [References]({{site.url}}/course-information/technical-reports/references)

## How you'll be graded

- Each group will turn in one comprehensive technical report at the end of the semester, written as a team.  
- The writing of this report will be completed in stages.  
  - You will submit sections throughout the semester and will be given *qualitative* feedback on that section.  
  - You will then be expected to integrate this feedback into your report before submitting it at the end of the semester.  
  - Peer review will also be used as a tool for providing feedback.  
  
  *The more polished your draft is the more I am able to give you meaningful feedback and the higher your final grade will be!*

- Your final submission will be graded *quantitatively* according to the lab ***[report rubric](https://github.com/alphonse/alphonse.github.io/raw/master/chem370/pdf/lab-report-rubric.pdf)*** (PDF).
