## Lab Assignments

I put a lot of trust in you to complete your lab assignments, do them well, and ask questions when you don't understand something.  Many assignments will be "graded" automatically -- you will get feedback on screen as you complete them.  You may not get a formal grade for these, but neglecting them will certainly have a detrimental effect on your grade later in the semester!  Below are lists of the items that will be assessed for a grade.  

(*Assignment lists may change as needed or if class is moved to an online modality.*)

### Individual (Lab)

- Lab 0 Tutorials (Exercises 0A & 0B)
- 5 lab notebooks (1 for each intro labs and 3 for the project lab)
- 4 instrument quizzes
- 1 peer review assignment
- Lab safety & participation
- Group participation

### Group Assignments (Lab)

- 1 lab report (plus additional draft assignments)

There are no exams.  Lab notebooks consist of data processing completed in a Markdown notebook and a data processing language (e.g. Pluto and Julia, respectively).

*Please see the syllabus for a complete explanation of grading schemes.*

## Lecture Assignments

- There will be **4 exams** plus a final.  Each exam will cover one unit of the course, and the final will be comprehensive.  Formats will usually be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and calculation problems.
- There will be additional in class problem sets, homework, and quizzes assigned and graded as needed throughout the semester.
- There will be assigned reading associated with every class meeting.  Students are *strong encouraged* to stay on top of reading the textbooks and to take notes while they read!
