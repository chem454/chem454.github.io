# CHEM / PHYS 454 & 554: Computer Interfacing

Computers have become an integral part of the experimental chemistry and physics laboratories.  This course provides an introduction to methods of using computers to interface with common laboratory equipment.  Topics covered will include basic analog electronics (RC circuits and op-amps), serial communication, microcontroller usage and programming, and data acquisition. This course is cross-listed with PHYS 454.

# Logistics

- Course materials will be posted on this site.
- Homework will be posted and submitted electronically on Canvas.    
- General questions should be asked through Piazza.   [ [Video: How to use Piazza](https://wcu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0abad82d-58e0-49c9-aa39-acb8012e0a2e) ]
- Office hours meetings should be scheduled in advance. See my availability and schedule an appointment on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/drfischer/office-hours). You will be able to choose to meet on Zoom or at my office during scheduling.  (No need to email or ask - just schedule!)

# Anticipated Assignments

Most assignments in this course will be centered around the construction of a working instrument.  Prior to Spring Break students will work to develop a design for their instrument.  All students should begin constructing their instruments no later than the week returning from Spring Break.

- Weekly(-ish) homework assignments (Individual)
- Weekly(-ish) Arduino / Teensy assignments (Individual)
- Instrument build project (Group)
	- Bi-weekly design review check-ins
	- Presentation on proposed design (midterm)
	- Instrument design packet (midterm)
	- Instrument hardware working
	- Instrument software working
	- Data collection / validation activity
	- Instrument technical datasheet
- Final exam (individual)

*Please see the syllabus for a complete explanation of grading schemes.*

## Graduate Projects

Graduate students will complete additional activities over the course of the semester:

1. A graduate project involving computational circuit analysis, with modules due throughout the semester.
1. Modify their instrument to incorporate additional functionality.
1. Answer additional questions on exams.

## Reading

- There will be assigned readings from the textbook associated with every class meeting.  Students are *strong encouraged* to stay on top of reading the textbooks, to take notes while they read, and to come to class with questions!
- There may occassionally be, for example, journal articles or white papers assigned for class discussion.  These should be read *before* the day of the discussion.
