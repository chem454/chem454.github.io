# CHEM / PHYS 454 & 554: Computer Interfacing
Computers, and more recently sensors and microcontrollers, have become an integral part of the experimental chemistry and physics laboratories.  This course provides an introduction to the development of custom instruments and data acquisition (DAQ) systems using basic electronic components.  Topics covered may include basic analog electronics (RC circuits and op-amps), communication protocols, microcontroller usage and programming, component selection, graphic user interface (GUI) creation, and test and validation methods. 

Although this course covers topics from the field of electronics, it is designed to help you be a better experimental scientist; it is not designed to help you become an electrical engineer. Hopefully it will help you develop a practical understanding of electronics and programming so that you will be better able to setup, troubleshoot, construct, and utilize scientific equipment.  The course assumes no previous experience in electronics or programming, just a willingness to learn and experiment.


The preface of the course textbook provides a nice summary of our goals for this semester:

> Inventors in the field of electronics are individuals who possess the knowledge, intuition, creativity, and technical know-how to turn their ideas into real-life electrical gadgets.  We hope this [course] will provide you with an intuitive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of electronics in a way that fuels your creativity...This [course] is designed to help [scientists] invent.  It assumes little to no prior knowledge of electronics.

This course is cross-listed with PHYS 454 and CHEM 554.

# Logistics

- Course materials will be posted on this site.
- Homework will be posted and submitted electronically on Canvas.    
- General questions should be asked through Piazza.   [ [Video: How to use Piazza](https://wcu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0abad82d-58e0-49c9-aa39-acb8012e0a2e) ]
- Office hours meetings should be scheduled in advance. See my availability and schedule an appointment on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/drfischer/office-hours). You will be able to choose to meet on Zoom or at my office during scheduling.  (No need to email or ask - just schedule!)

# Anticipated Assignments

Most assignments in this course will be centered around the construction of a working instrument.  Prior to Spring Break students will work to develop a design for their instrument.  All students should begin constructing their instruments no later than the week returning from Spring Break.

- Weekly(-ish) homework assignments (Individual)
- Weekly(-ish) Arduino / Teensy assignments (Individual)
- Instrument build project (Group)
	- Bi-weekly design review check-ins
	- Presentation on proposed design (midterm)
	- Instrument design packet (midterm)
	- Instrument hardware working
	- Instrument software working
	- Data collection / validation activity
	- Instrument technical datasheet
- Final exam (individual)

*Please see the syllabus for a complete explanation of grading schemes.*

## Graduate Projects

Graduate students will complete additional activities over the course of the semester:

1. A graduate project involving computational circuit analysis, with modules due throughout the semester.
1. Modify their instrument to incorporate additional functionality.
1. Answer additional questions on exams.

## Reading

- There will be assigned readings from the textbook associated with every class meeting.  Students are *strong encouraged* to stay on top of reading the textbooks, to take notes while they read, and to come to class with questions!
- There may occassionally be, for example, journal articles or white papers assigned for class discussion.  These should be read *before* the day of the discussion.
